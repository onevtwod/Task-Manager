1. **Project Setup**:
    - Choose your tech stack. Since you mentioned full-stack development, let’s use **React** for the front end and **Node.js with Express** for the back end.
    - Set up a new project directory and initialize it with your preferred package manager (npm or yarn).
2. **Front-End Development**:
    - Create the user interface for your task manager using React. Here are some components you’ll need:
        - **Task List**: Display a list of tasks with options to mark them as complete or delete them.
        - **Add Task Form**: Allow users to add new tasks.
        - **Task Details Modal**: Show additional details when a user clicks on a task.
    - Use React Router for navigation between different views (e.g., task list, task details).
3. **Back-End Development**:
    - Set up your Express server. Define routes for handling tasks (CRUD operations).
    - Create a simple database (you can start with SQLite or MongoDB) to store task data.
    - Implement API endpoints for:
        - Fetching all tasks
        - Adding a new task
        - Updating task status (complete/incomplete)
        - Deleting a task
4. **Database Design**:
    - Decide on the structure of your task data. A basic schema might include fields like:
        - Task ID
        - Task title
        - Task description
        - Completion status
    - Create database models (if using an ORM like Mongoose for MongoDB).
5. **User Authentication**:
    - Implement user authentication (signup and login). You can use libraries like **Passport.js** for this.
    - Secure your API endpoints so that only authenticated users can access them.
6. **Front-End Integration with Back End**:
    - Make API requests from your React components to fetch tasks, add new tasks, and update task status.
    - Handle responses and update the UI accordingly.
7. **Real-Time Updates (Optional)**:
    - If you want real-time updates (e.g., when another user adds a task), consider using WebSockets (Socket.io) or server-sent events (SSE).
8. **Styling and UI**:
    - Style your task manager using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components).
    - Make it responsive and visually appealing.
9. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Write unit tests for both front-end and back-end components.
    - Validate user inputs (client-side and server-side) to prevent security vulnerabilities.
10. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy your application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, or AWS).
    - Set up environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
11. **Documentation and Code Organization**:
    - Document your code (README.md) with setup instructions, project overview, and usage details.
    - Organize your codebase into meaningful directories (e.g., `src`, `components`, `routes`).
